  - Versioning of CSS and JS files (cache busting)
  - CSS and JS files will be included automatically
  - Comes with Bootstrap and AngularJS configured to work together at their best
  
## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/sarancruzer/listeo-dev.git
```
```
composer install 
```
```

### Database setup

Edit `.env.example` according to your environment and save as `.env`.
An application key can be generates with the command `php artisan key:generate`.

Run these commands to create the tables within the database you have already created.

```
php artisan migrate:install
```
```
php artisan migrate:refresh
```

If you get an error like a `PDOException` try editing your `.env` file and change `DB_HOST=localhost` to `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`. If that doesn’t work, file an issue on GitHub, I will be glad to help.
